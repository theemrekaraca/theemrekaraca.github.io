    <h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod">1.Jeff Bezos</h1>
    <p>Net Worth: $112 billion</p> 
        <p>Founder: <a href="https://www.amazon.com.tr/">Amazon (AMZN)</a></p>
        <p style="text-align:initial; border:15px solid rgb(150,200,250)">1994, Bezos founded Amazon.com in a garage in Seattle, shortly after he resigned from the hedge fund giant D.E. Shaw. In fact, he had originally pitched the idea of an online bookstore to his former boss David E. Shaw (a rumor that Shaw himself has confirmed), who wasn't interested.
        
        Though <strong> Amazon.com</strong> originally started out selling books, it has since morphed into a one-stop-shop for everything under the sun, and is arguably the world's most important retailer. At any rate, it is hard to dispute its self-description as the "earth's most customer-centric company." Its pattern of constant diversification is evident in some of its unexpected recent expansions, which include its acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 and its launching of its own branded over-the-counter drugs in February 2018.

Bezos' other projects include aerospace company Blue Origin, the Washington Post (which he bought in 2013), and the 10,000-year clock, also known as the Long Now.

            <p>The most famous living value investor, Warren Buffet filed his first tax return in 1944 at age 14, declaring his earnings from his boyhood paper route.

                He first bought shares in a textile company called Berkshire Hathaway in 1962, becoming the majority shareholder by 1964. He expanded the company to the insurance and other investments in 1967. Now, Berkshire Hathaway is a half-trillion-dollar company, with a single share of stock trading at over $300,000 per share. 
                
                
                </p>
                <p>Warren Buffett is widely known as <mark>“The Oracle of Omaha” </mark>because of his knack for value investing, in other words, finding bargains in undervalued companies. While most investors have been piling into social media companies, Buffett has repeatedly stated that it’s too difficult to determine their value, and has instead stuck with investments that he thinks will pay off 10 years down the road. He is also a noted Bitcoin skeptic.
